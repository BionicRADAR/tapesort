# tapesort
A Java tapesort implementation. Written when I was partway through college and for an assignment, so it is fairly messy, but it works. Considering the reputation tapesort had at my college (for being difficult), I was happy to find it fairly easy and write multiple varieties of tapesorts.
Included are a basic 3-tape sort, a sort for an arbitrary number of tapes, and a balanced tapesort for any even number of tapes. The sorts use generics, allowing them to be used for any Comparable. The sorts are in TapeSorter.java. Also, there are classes to simulate a tape (Tape.java and Node.java), and another class for performance rating, the CompCounter (CompCounter.java)
This project was originally a part of a class project that included testing the performance of various sorts against each other, thus some code can be found in there for counting comparisons and number of writes.
